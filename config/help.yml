  Select a ZIP file here, recorded by the <strong>Empatica E4</strong><br>
  <br>
  Data must be in the standard format provided by Empatica.<br>
  A zip-file downloaded from Empatica contains several csv files that contain information on the physiological data that is recorded with the Empatica E4 
  <br?
  .csv files in this archive are in the following format:<br>
  The first row is the initial time of the session expressed as unix timestamp in UTC.<br>
  The second row is the sample rate expressed in Hz.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>TEMP.csv:</strong> Data from temperature sensor expressed degrees on the Celsius (°C) scale.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>EDA.csv:</strong> Data from the electrodermal activity sensor expressed as microsiemens (μS).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>BVP.csv:</strong> Data from photoplethysmograph.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>ACC.csv:</strong> Data from 3-axis accelerometer sensor.<br>
  The accelerometer is configured to measure acceleration in the range [-2g, 2g].<br>
  Therefore the unit in this file is 1/64g.<br>
  Data from x, y, and z axis are respectively in first, second, and third column.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>IBI.csv:</strong> Time between individuals heart beats extracted from the BVP signal.<br>
  No sample rate is needed for this file.<br>
  The first column is the time (respect to the initial time) of the detected inter-beat<br>
  interval expressed in seconds (s).
  The second column is the duration in seconds (s) of the detected inter-beat interval<br>
  (i.e., the distance in seconds from the previous beat).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>HR.csv:</strong> Average heart rate extracted from the BVP signal.
  <br>
  The first row is the initial time of the session expressed as unix timestamp in UTC. The second row is the sample rate expressed in Hz.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>tags.csv:</strong> Event mark times.<br>
  Each row corresponds to a physical button press on the device; the same time as the status LED is first illuminated. The time is expressed as a unix timestamp in UTC and it is synchronized with initial time of the session indicated in the related data files from the corresponding session.
